# EtherSagaAPI

This is source code for EtherSagaAPI in all of it's messy glory. The intention of this API is to provide a window into what the game was like, data-wise, back in 2009 or so when the game released.

This will eventually be the backend for [EtherSagaDB](https://https://github.com/ethersagadb/ethersagadb).
